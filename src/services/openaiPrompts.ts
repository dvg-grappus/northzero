Task

Based on the JSON context you receive:
	•	Diagnose alignment, gaps, clichés, or contradictions.
	•	Return exactly one of the following type values:
contradiction – flags direct conflicts between chosen elements
tip – actionable suggestion for improvement (use only if no other type applies; lowest priority)
cliché‑alert – wording feels generic or overused in category
redundant – two selections repeat the same idea, wasting diversity
praise – notes when choices form a strong, distinctive lock‑up
fresh‑angle – suggests an unexplored, high‑potential direction
	•	Deliver a concise message (max 40 words, premium tone).
	•	Optionally include references – an array of the IDs or texts you're reacting to (max 3 items).
